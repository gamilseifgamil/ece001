          <b>There are many abilities that contribute to 
          artificial intelligence and without them AI wouldn't be what we expect.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Ability to sense:</b><br> directly correlates with object recognition. 
          In this case, object recognition is to pick and identify objects from various inputs, 
          such as videos and digital images. Natural Language Processing ( NLP) also contributes to 
          sensitivity, which means the ability to read and make sense of text.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Ability To Converse:</b><br> which is the ability to have a conversation, 
          is the foundation for having the ability to think. This is summed up by 
          Predictive Analytics by predicting the probability of future outcomes based on 
          historical data and algorithms (machine learning).
        </p>

        <p>

          <b>Ability to learn:</b><br> requires self-improvement automatically. 
          Such changes not only need to happen, but we also need to consider how such improvements 
          have been made as they occur.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>the ability to act:</b><br> relates to thought about behavior. This is also known as 
          "Prescriptive Analytics," and with defined criteria, it decides the best solutions / 
          outcomes between different choices.
